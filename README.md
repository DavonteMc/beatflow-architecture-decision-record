# Architecture Decision Record: Development framework
This is the architecture decision record for the beatflow app developed for CPRG303.

## Development Framework
### Summary
#### Issue 
We want to use a development framework that:
- We are familiar with
- Enables cross-platform functionality later down the line
- Has an active community that provides numerous resources to speed up development

#### Decision 
Decided on React Native as the development framework.

#### Status
Decided on React Native. 

### Details
#### Assumptions 
We believe that React Native is the best development platform for us because:
- It is cross-platform which would make it easy to develop an iOS app for later on
- It is free for us to use
- Has a robust community that provides valuable tools to aid in development and can be contacted if needed
- We would be able to get in-person support with issues that arise since our instructor specializes in this framework

#### Constraints 
If we choose a framework that outside of React Native, we would have to learn a new framework which would halt our progress heavily.

If we choose React Native we may be limited in our access to Spotify and may have to focus the app's functionality on local storage.

## Navigation Strategy
### Summary
#### Issue 
We want to use a navigation strategy that: 
- Is familiar to users who already use music apps like Spotify, Apple Music, or Youtube Music.
- Concentrates the primary navigation to the bottom of the screen
- Creates a minimal design

#### Decision 
Decided on tab navigation.

#### Status 
Decided on tab navigation. Open to a more flexible navigation stratgey.

### Details
#### Assumptions 
With a tab navigation strategy: 
- We can keep the UI minimal while providing the user with the ability to easily navigate throughout
- We can create a user-friendly UI
- We will be restricted to 4-5 main options 

#### Constraints 
If we go with tab navigation, our ability to make a clean an minimal design will be limited by the tab navigation bar's
occupation of screen space. 

If we go with tab navigation, we will be restricted to 4-5 main options for navigation.

#### Positions
We are able to keep things minilmal

## Hardware
### Summary
#### Issue 
We need to access hardware that will:
- Enable volume controls
- Output sounds
- Enable the transference of audio to bluetooth devices

#### Decision 
Decided on speaker, bluetooth and external volume buttons.

#### Status 
Decided on speaker, bluetooth and external volume buttons. Open to the fingerprint scanner as well for quick sign-in if possible. 

### Details
#### Assumptions 
With access to the phone's speaker, bluetooth and external volume buttons:
- We will be able to
